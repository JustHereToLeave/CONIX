# The CONIX Project
## What is CONIX?
CONIX is a UNIX-like operating system. No, I, in fact, do not know how to program in C, C++, Assembly, or Rust, whatsoever.
## Who is CONIX?
It's in the name! CONIX means "Coen Unix". I am Coen Buck, a 13 year old Linux enthusiast and programmer (probably not enough to call myself a software engineer). I am the only person working on CONIX.
## When is CONIX?
I don't know. I am actively going to school 5 days a week, only working on CONIX in the evenings and on weekends, as a hobby. So, whenever it gets done, it will be released, and hopefully I'll have enough time to properly maintain it afterwards and not get bored of it.
## Where is CONIX?
On your computer, one day, hopefully. CONIX is entirely developed by me, alone, at my family home in Zanesville, Ohio, in the United States.
## How is CONIX?
Assuming this question means "how does it work?" I myself barely have an idea of what the answer to that could be. It just does.

<sub>There is probably more to come. Eventually.</sub>

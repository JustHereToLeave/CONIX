# The CONIX Project
## What is CONIX?
CONIX is a Linux distribution based on Arch Linux. It features the Calamares graphical installer, a GUI package manager for pacman and AUR, and a GUI customization tool that is currently only planned to work with KDE Plasma (but may be compatible with others in the future).
## Why is CONIX?
The philosophy behind CONIX is best described in one word: Speed. Arch Linux, and more specifically pacman, is extremely fast at doing its job, and doing it well. Unfortunately, the vast majority of individuals don't understand how to use terminal, or are too busy (or lazy) to figure it out, so they instead stick with out of the box simple Windows. The intention with CONIX is to allow the majority of standard non-technical users to use Arch Linux and experience the benefits of its speed and customizability without having to even open up the terminal.
## Who is CONIX?
It's in the name! CONIX means "Coen Unix". CONIX is not Unix, but it originally *was* going to be a Unix-based kernel and OS built on top of that kernel. You can probably guess why I gave up on that idea. I am Coen Buck, a 13 year old Linux enthusiast and programmer (probably not enough to call myself a software engineer). I am the only person working on CONIX.
## When is CONIX?
I don't know. I am actively going to school 5 days a week, only working on CONIX in the evenings and on weekends, as a hobby. So, whenever it gets done, it will be released, and hopefully I'll have enough time to properly maintain it afterwards and not get bored of it.
## Where is CONIX?
On your computer, hopefully. CONIX is entirely developed by me, alone, at my family home in Zanesville, Ohio, in the United States.
## How is CONIX?
Assuming this question means "how does it work?" I myself barely have an idea of what the answer to that could be. It just does.

# Major Features
## CONIX Package Manager
The CONIX Package Manager is a GUI package management application for CONIX Linux. Similar to Manjaro's pamac, it is a GUI interface for working with packages, also serving as an AUR helper. It provides logos and description information for packages and simplifies the Linux program management process by enabling users to add popular repositories and install/remove packages with the click of a button. Utilizing pacman, package management on CONIX is blazingly fast, and the CPM GUI allows users to simply install an application, like on any other consumer operating system.
## CONIX Control Panel
The CONIX Control Panel is CONIX's application for managing system settings. It expands on Plasma's system settings application in a major way, allowing users to fully customize every single element of their desktop environment (Plasma specifically, for now) without having to do so much as open a terminal. CONIX Control Panel is intended to allow users to get as much as possible from their system without having to use the terminal if they do not wish to.

<sub>There is probably more to come. Eventually.</sub>
